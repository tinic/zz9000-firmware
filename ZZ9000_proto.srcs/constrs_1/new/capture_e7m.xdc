# The 35.000 ns E7M declaration above is a modeling fiction: it keeps the
# MMCM's modeled VCO (x32) above the Artix-7 FVCOMIN of 600 MHz. Physically
# E7M is 7.094 MHz (PAL) / 7.159 MHz (NTSC), so the MMCM-derived capture
# clock on CLKOUT0 (CLKIN x4) really runs at 28.375/28.636 MHz - period
# 35.24/34.93 ns - while STA analyzes it at 8.750 ns, exactly 4x too fast.
# Restore the physical single-cycle budget for intra-capture-domain paths
# with a 4-cycle setup multicycle (3-cycle hold keeps the original
# adjacent-edge hold relationship). Cross-domain paths are unaffected:
# the CLKOUT0->ACLK crossing is bounded with set_max_delay -datapath_only
# in zz9000.xdc and uses XPM/handshake synchronization. Without this
# correction, deep capture-domain logic such as the E7M-locked sample-grid
# pairing (17 logic levels, ~12.5 ns) can never meet the fictional 8.75 ns
# budget and the post-route timing gate rejects physically sound builds.
