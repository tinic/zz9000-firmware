 * frames finished -- sent, or dropped for want of a BD, which the driver

 * 2 IP and TCP, 3 IP and UDP checked good (the GEM discards frames whose
 * checksum it found bad).  A driver can then skip summing the payload.
 * Bit 14: transmit checksum insertion is on; a driver may zero the TCP/UDP
 * checksum field of an IPv4 frame and the GEM fills it.  Older firmware
 * reads the register as 0: no capabilities, no verdict.
 *
 * Lifetime: the verdict belongs to the frame shown in
 * the RX window and is valid from the read of its header until the host's
 * REG_ZZ_ETH_RX acknowledge; read it in between.  Bits 1..0 mean a verdict
 * only while bit 15 is set: with the receive engine off the descriptor bits
 * mean something else and are reported as 0.  A reset of the receive path
 * (DMA restart, MAC change) clears every slot's verdict to 0 along with the
 * frames.  The engines are configured once at start-up and do not change
 * while the firmware runs, so the capability bits read at attach stay true.
