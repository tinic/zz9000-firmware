/* Lease preconvert staging (drivers#83 follow-up: the #100 discipline
 * on the lease plane). A converting lease (source rate other than
 * 48 kHz) gets its whole source periods converted on the main loop
 * (audio_fabric_lease_poll) into a private staging ring of 48-kHz
 * periods; the compositor ISR fill then only copies. Each staging
 * period carries the whole-period source-byte cost, so the
 * period-tag/credit plane stays source-denominated and the producer
 * line's cursors are untouched (the ISR's stage op still advances
 * lease.consumed by exactly that cost).
 *
 * The 32-bit staging cursors wrap after ~6.2 h of continuous
 * converted playback; the poll rebases both under an IRQ-safe
 * critical section exactly like the pump's preconvert ring (PR #88
 * review), so the ISR's single-word reads never tear and the modulo
 * ring position never jumps (2^32 is not a multiple of the staging
 * ring size). */
