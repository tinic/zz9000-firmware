/*
 * ZZ9000AX audio fabric compositor: the single firmware writer of the
 * formatter TX ring (plan U2, R1).
 *
 * The compositor absorbs the playback pump's per-period fill loop
 * (frontier scheduling, retirement, cache discipline, silence policy)
 * that used to live in sdk_mailbox.c's core-0 TX ISR. Decode-side
 * machinery -- feeds, backpressure kicks, drain accounting -- stays
 * with the producer owners. Every SDK audio playback path binds here
 * as a producer in a bounded slot table; legacy/AHI register playback
 * keeps its exclusive window through a three-way ownership state:
 *
 *   IDLE               nobody owns the output,
 *   LEGACY_EXCLUSIVE   a register-driven (AHI) client owns the output,
 *   FABRIC_ACTIVE      the compositor owns the output; legacy entry is
 *                      rejected and the formatter is never repointed.
 *
 * Producer #1 is the SDK pump slot (audio streams and media sessions,
 * routed implicitly from their first bind); slots 2 and 3 are the
 * direct-ring lease plane (opcodes 0x0512+: the SDK producer writes
 * PCM and a seqlock control line straight into its board-visible
 * grant; mailbox copy-submit is never on the data path). The per-slot
 * mix discipline is saturating int32 accumulate then one S16 clamp
 * per frame (KTD4); a late, absent, paused or malformed producer
 * contributes silence without stalling the others and only its own
 * underrun counter moves (R8).
