/*
 * Firmware-authoritative audio control plane arbiter (plan U2, KTD2):
 * scene state, split authority, gain staging against the enforced
 * saturation boundary, and -- since U3 -- the per-direction metering
 * accumulators with coherent snapshots (KTD3). Since U4 it also owns
 * the staged-edit drafts and the single KTD7 glitch-free commit path
 * (fade -> ordered verified writes -> restore) that every
 * master-chain change funnels through; that commit runs as an
 * incremental state machine driven by audio_scene_poll(), one DSP
 * setter call per call, so the dispatch path never blocks on the
 * ~170-transaction I2C sequence. Live edits (staged SCENE_WRITE
 * commits, baseline changes) run that machine differentially: only
 * the parameters that differ from the last applied state, with no
 * fade, so a parameter drag costs one setter call per change. The
 * scene save runs the same way: audio_scene_poll() drives the
 * temp-then-replace SD sequence one FatFs call per step (the
 * non-blocking save machine below), so a stalled card can no longer
 * freeze the service loop.
 *
 * Holds the scene state, the operator baseline balance, per-owner
 * source trims, the enforced saturation boundary, and the
 * gain-reduction telemetry accumulator. Every master-chain write
 * reaches the ADAU1701 through this module's calls into the ax.h
 * setters -- the legacy register path is gated by
 * audio_scene_register_write_blocked() in main.c (R2).
 *
 * Metering (U3, KTD3): per-direction single-writer volatile
 * accumulators fed by the audio formatter ISRs through bounded
 * per-period scans, and seqlock-framed coherent snapshots consumed by
 * the meter-read dispatch. See the metering section below.
 *
 * Gain staging (R7) weights Paula by ceiling_ax/ceiling_paula,
 * clamps each leg to its configured ceiling, then bounds the
 * weighted mix after scene prefactor, volume and worst positive EQ
 * gain. The conservative 48/80 fallback came from one measured R1
 * card; it reduces first-run gain but is not a clean guarantee across
 * board revisions. Saved per-card values remain authoritative.
 *
 * Host tests link this file without ax.c and provide recording DSP
 * setters (test/audio/audio_scene_test.c).

 * resolved volume, composed mixer stage), so table edits that arrive
 * mid-flight can never tear the running sequence: they coalesce into
 * a pending target that a fresh machine applies when this one
 * reaches its terminal state.
 *
 * Differential mode (the fast path): a live single-parameter edit --
 * a staged SCENE_WRITE commit or a direct baseline change -- runs
 * the same machine with a todo list of only the parameters that
 * differ from the last successfully applied state: no fade, no
 * restore, one setter per changed parameter. Scene selects and DSP
