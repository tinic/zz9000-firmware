 * The vendor SD stack (xsdps.c / diskio.c) contains unbounded polling
 * loops (card-detect settling, command-line reset, ACMD41 ready, RCA
 * acquisition, clock stabilization, voltage switch). The boot-time
 * ZZ9000.CFG load races the Amiga's autoconfig pass, so it arms a
 * deadline before touching the card: every wait on that path then
 * polls sd_boot_deadline_hit() and fails fast instead of hanging.
 *
 * Arming is boot-only. Disarmed (deadline 0), every loop behaves
 * exactly as the vendor driver, so later SD users -- HDF storage,
 * firmware update, config saves -- keep their existing semantics.
