# ZZ9000 Firmware

FPGA logic and bare-metal ARM firmware for the MNT ZZ9000 Zorro II/III
graphics and coprocessor card.

This repository contains the Zorro bus interface, video formatter,
scanline generator, AXI plumbing, boot image layout, and `ZZ9000OS`
firmware that runs on the Zynq-7020 ARM core. The matching Amiga-side
drivers and tools live in
[BlitterStudio/zz9000-drivers](https://github.com/BlitterStudio/zz9000-drivers).

> **Fork notice:** this is the BlitterStudio firmware fork, maintained by
> Dimitris Panokostas / midwan. It continues the original MNT ZZ9000
> firmware sources, but is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported
> by MNT Research GmbH. Hardware support questions belong with MNT;
> firmware issues for this fork belong in this repository.

## What Changed Since the Original MNT Firmware

The original MNT project established the ZZ9000 hardware and its core Amiga
support. This independent BlitterStudio fork continues from those pre-fork
sources and turns the card into a broader, easier-to-use graphics and
coprocessor platform. These are the highest-value differences for an owner:

| Improvement | What it means in everyday use |
|---|---|
| **Sharper and more compatible native Amiga video** | Full-rate variants preserve the complete 28 MHz Amiga pixel stream, including SuperHires detail. Native video can be shown pixel-exact at 1280x1024 or centered unchanged inside a monitor-friendly 1920x1080 picture with clean black borders. |
| **Live picture positioning** | Current ZZTop and matched firmware can open a calibration screen and move the captured Amiga picture with the cursor keys. You no longer need a long edit, reboot, inspect, and repeat cycle just to center the image. |
| **Faster, more capable RTG output** | The fork adds substantial Picasso96 acceleration and fixes, a 64-bit display path, high-resolution Zorro III modes including 1920x1080x32, monitor power management, improved scanlines, and a hardware-scaled video window. |
| **Video and audio playback on the card** | The two ARM cores can decode MPEG-1 video and MPEG audio for the SDK's **ZZPlay** application, keeping the classic Amiga CPU free for the interface and other work. Playback can use a window on Workbench or a dedicated screen. |
| **Hardware-assisted images, archives, audio and secure networking** | Firmware services accelerate JPEG/PNG work, MP3/audio streaming, LHA/LZH decompression, and selected cryptography used by the accelerated AmiSSL build. Applications fall back safely when a service is unavailable. |
| **Settings without special firmware builds** | One readable `ZZ9000.CFG` file on the microSD card now controls native-video profiles, framing, scanlines, INT2, MAC address, PIP/off-screen features, and the boot HDF. The old separate `ns-pal` firmware flavor is no longer needed. |
| **Updates and recovery from AmigaOS** | `ZZFwUpdate` can install firmware files without removing the microSD card, keeps a `.bak` copy when replacing a file, and can restore that backup if an update boots but misbehaves. |
| **More supported machines and card configurations** | Releases maintain nine FPGA images covering AGA (video-slot) and E7M capture, Zorro III, Zorro II, A500/ZZ9500CX, 2 MB, no-Fast-RAM, and Super Denise configurations. |

The less visible work matters too: USB 2.0/Poseidon support, gigabit Ethernet,
SD-card HDF boot, on-board audio improvements, safer Zorro II memory sharing,
and a reproducible GCC/Docker/CI build and release process. FPGA releases are
built and timing-checked for every supported hardware variant.

The firmware, AmigaOS drivers, and SDK applications are designed as one
matched release. This is especially important on Zorro II, where the current
stack safely agrees which parts of the smaller 2 MB or 4 MB address window may
be used. Both shipped Zorro II profiles support compact image, archive, audio,
and secure-network services; the 4 MB profile also has room for one bounded
ZZPlay picture-in-picture source. See the SDK's
[plain-language Zorro II service matrix](https://github.com/BlitterStudio/zz9000-sdk/blob/master/docs/zz9k-zorro2-services.md)
for the exact limits.

## Installing Firmware

Tagged releases attach ZIPs that each contain a user-facing `BOOT.bin`
and sample `ZZ9000.CFG`. Release notes and change history live on the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/BlitterStudio/zz9000-firmware/releases)
page.

The direct update path is:

1. Download or build the correct release ZIP for the target hardware.
2. Extract its `BOOT.bin`.
3. Copy `BOOT.bin` to the ZZ9000 FAT32 microSD card, using the filename
   required by the card's QSPI/SD boot setup.
4. Power-cycle the Amiga.

Firmware builds with FWUP support can also receive a new `BOOT.bin` from
AmigaOS using `ZZFwUpdate` from
[zz9000-drivers](https://github.com/BlitterStudio/zz9000-drivers). FWUP
writes through the ZZ9000 register window to the mounted FAT32 microSD
card, stages the upload through a temporary file, then replaces the
target on close. If an existing file is replaced, it is kept as a
same-name `.bak` backup, such as `BOOT.bak`.

FWUP accepts flat root-level filenames only: up to 64 characters, simple
ASCII letters/digits plus `.`, `_`, and `-`, with no path separators.
Power-cycle the Amiga after replacing `BOOT.bin`.

## Board / Bitstream Variants

Use the ZIP whose board/bitstream variant matches the target machine:

| Variant | Use for |
|---|---|
| `zorro3` | A3000/A4000 with optional Zorro III FastRAM; E7M capture |
| `zorro3-aga` | A4000/A4000T AGA with the 28 MHz video-slot connection, optional Zorro III FastRAM; AGA capture (renamed from `zorro3-a4000-c28`) |
| `zorro2` | A2000, Zorro II, 4 MB window |
| `zorro2-2mb` | A2000, Zorro II, 2 MB window |
| `a500` | A500 with ZZ9500CX Denise adapter, 4 MB window |
| `a500-2mb` | A500 with ZZ9500CX Denise adapter, 2 MB window |
| `a500plus` | A500+ or Super Denise with ZZ9500CX Denise adapter |

These are hardware/autoconfig bitstream variants; they use one ARM firmware.
Zorro III FastRAM is no longer a bitstream choice: it is off by default and
enabled with `fast_ram = on` in [`ZZ9000.CFG`](ZZ9000.CFG) (fail-closed —
absent, malformed, unreadable, or too-slow configuration boots without it,
which is the old `zorro3-nofast` behavior). Former `zorro3-nofast` /
`zorro3-nofast-aga` (former name) users need no CFG key; former `zorro3` /
`zorro3-aga` (formerly `zorro3-a4000-c28`) users add `fast_ram = on` to keep their RAM. Changes
take effect at the next reboot (a warm reset re-reads the card). If the
card is unusually slow at a warm reset, the re-read can finish after the
Amiga has already passed the Fast-RAM slot in autoconfig; the card then
boots without Fast RAM for that one pass (never wrongly enabled) and the
next reset picks it up again.

The AGA (formerly A4000 C28) images require the video-slot C28 connection. Do not install
them on an A3000 or Denise-adapter machine. Keep the E7M Zorro III images as
the A3000 builds and as an A4000 fallback. Settings that used to require a
separate firmware flavor or ENV: variables now live in the optional
`ZZ9000.CFG` config file (see below). Older releases also
shipped an `ns-pal` firmware flavor; its behavior is now the
`filtered_pal_exact` native-video profile in `ZZ9000.CFG`.

## Configuration File (ZZ9000.CFG)

`ZZ9000.CFG` is an optional text file stored beside `BOOT.bin` in the root of
the FAT32 microSD card. Firmware reads it at power-on; a soft reset does not
reload it, except `fast_ram`, which every reset re-reads to re-derive the
Fast-RAM advertisement. The easiest way to manage it is **ZZTop → Project →
Settings**. Release ZIPs also include a fully commented
[sample file](ZZ9000.CFG) for manual editing.

The file controls these boot-time defaults:

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `videocap_profile` | Native output: `full_60`, `full_exact`, `filtered_60` (default), `filtered_pal`, `filtered_pal_exact`, `filtered_ntsc_exact`, `centered_1080p_60`, `centered_1080p_50`, `centered_1080p_match` |
| `videocap_sample` | Native-video capture sampling |
| `videocap_phase` | Legacy E7M diagnostic phase, signed fine steps (`-255..255`); omit unless calibrated |
| `videocap_c28_phase` | A4000 C28 diagnostic phase, independent fine steps (`-896..895`); requires matching AGA (video-slot C28) bitstream |
| `videocap_crop_h` | Horizontal picture position; omit for Automatic |
| `videocap_crop_v` | Vertical picture position; omit for Automatic |
| `videocap_width` | Manual capture window width, 16-aligned words (`256..1280`); omit for Automatic |
| `videocap_height` | Manual capture window height in source lines (`100..1024`); omit for Automatic |
| `scanline_mode` | Scanline style, or off |
| `scanline_parity` | Which line is darkened |
| `int2` | Use INT2 instead of INT6 |
| `fast_ram` | Zorro III Fast RAM (Z3 images only), off by default and fail-closed; see [Board / Bitstream Variants](#board--bitstream-variants) |
| `offscreen_bitmaps` | Enable or disable Picasso96 off-screen bitmaps |
| `video_overlay` | Enable or disable the Picasso96 video window |
| `mac` | Ethernet MAC-address override |
| `hdf` | Root-level HDF image used for SD-card boot (default `zz9000.hdf`); `off` disables SD boot |

The audio control plane (ZZ9000AX) adds one group of keys per scene,
the active selection, operator baseline and per-card clean ceilings.
Values are plain decimals; band pairs and prefactor/volume pack two
0-100 fields as `hi*128+lo`, and baseline packs mixer legs as
`paula*256+ax` (0-255 each, 127 = 0 dB). The ceiling keys store
**measured** clean single-source levels (1-4095): firmware weights
Paula by `audio_ceiling_ax/audio_ceiling_paula`, caps each leg at its
configured ceiling, then bounds the combined output with a limiter.
With no saved calibration the conservative fallback ceilings are
Paula 48 / AX 80, based on one R1 card's measurements; with no saved
baseline, parity selects Paula 36 / AX 72 (weighted Level 132/160).
These are not verified clean limits for every board. Existing saved
`audio_ceiling_*` and `audio_baseline` values take precedence, including
older 256/256 or 192/255 settings; remove or recalibrate those keys
to adopt the new fallback. Do not increase ceilings to mask distortion.
LPF, EQ, prefactor and volume process the **shared** Paula/AX output.
Name keys pack two ASCII characters as `c1*256+c2`.

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `audio_active` | Audio scene slot (0-7) applied at boot and after every warm reset |
| `audio_baseline` | Operator Paula/AX balance packed paula*256+ax, replacing the old `ZZ9K_MIX_LEVELS` env var |
| `audio_ceiling_paula` | Measured clean Paula-only ceiling (1-4095); pair with `audio_ceiling_ax` |
| `audio_ceiling_ax` | Measured clean AX-only ceiling (1-4095); with the Paula ceiling it forms the enforced AX-equivalent boundary |
| `audio_scene0_lpf` | Scene 1 low-pass cutoff in Hz (1-23900; 23900 = DSP default) |

Absent audio keys keep the firmware defaults. The firmware applies the
saved active scene at cold boot and again after every Amiga warm
reset, before any application can allocate the audio device.

Both save mechanisms — ZZTop's Settings/Scandoubler **Save** and the
firmware-backed Audio **Save** — regenerate the file from settings they
know and keep the previous copy as `ZZ9000.bak`: hand-written comments
are not preserved. The file parser reads at most 8 KiB; a larger file
has its tail ignored, which the drivers can observe through the
config-query key `ZZ_CONFIG_KEY_AUDIO_TRUNCATED` (the audio keys
serialize last, so they are the first casualty of an oversized file).

For most systems, leave missing options at their defaults. A minimal custom
file might look like this:

```ini
videocap_profile = filtered_60
scanline_mode = 2
scanline_parity = 0
```

With no valid profile, `filtered_60` provides filtered 60 Hz output:
800x600 for PAL input or 720x480 for NTSC input. Explicit `full_60` and
`full_exact` selections preserve full SuperHires detail in a 1280x1024 output.
Fullscan scales vertically by an integer factor on the classic power-of-two
paths, so every source row is duplicated uniformly: PAL's 256 progressive or
512 interlaced source rows fill the 1024-line raster at x4/x2, while 15 kHz
NTSC letterboxes the same 800 lines for both 200 progressive rows at x4 and
400 interlaced rows at x2 (112-line black bars, centered). Short-line
NTSC-class sources such as Euro72 and DblNTSC do not take that letterbox:
their row-class factor already shows the captured rows, and an 800-line
viewport would clip the bottom. Progressive and interlaced 15 kHz pictures
therefore render at one physical size per standard, matching a real monitor.

On full-rate doubled sources such as DblPAL and Euro72, the measured
640-pixel line is repeated 2x horizontally and the existing row-class
factor scales vertically. A 640x512 class-2 source fills the 1280x1024
capture raster; centered 1080p places that raster at (320,28). Class-1 and
tall class-3 sources retain vertical x4 and x1 respectively. Filtered capture
and short-line, non-doubled Super72 keep their existing horizontal sampling.
SCALEX affects displayed pixels only; 32-bit VDMA rows retain their full
content pitch.

On supported full-rate variants,
`centered_1080p_60` and `centered_1080p_50`
place the native picture in a 1920x1080 signal with 320-pixel side borders
and 28-line top/bottom borders; a 15 kHz NTSC source letterboxes inside
that viewport with the same integer scaling. Their nominal 60/50 Hz
timings run at approximately 60.03/50.02 Hz. Both use the closest legal
100 MHz integer-PLL setting to 148.5 MHz: 52/5/7 = 148.5714286 MHz, with
standard blanking unchanged. They are free-running, not input-genlocked.
These native profiles are separate from Picasso96 RTG modes, but centered
60 Hz shares its hardware timing preset with 1920x1080 RTG. The matching
driver and stock Picasso96 settings use the updated clock metadata too.
Centered 60 Hz needs firmware capability
bit 3; centered 50 Hz needs both bits 3 and 4. These are advertised only
on matching viewport/full-rate bitstreams. Use matching firmware, bitstream,
`ZZ9000.card` and ZZTop. Current ZZTop hides unsupported centered choices
and substitutes `full_60` when loading an unsupported selection; that
fallback also applies when another configuration window saves a stored
unsupported profile. Older firmware ignores an unknown profile token,
which is not a guaranteed `full_60` fallback for hand-edited old stacks.
Capture-window overrides use `videocap_width` and `videocap_height`; set either
axis to 0 (or omit its CFG key) to retain that axis's automatic dimension.
On a filtered profile the override is centered in the active mode canvas
(800x600, 720x576, or 720x480), not in the 1280x1024 fullscan box.
Firmware capability bit 8 accepts the live `CARD_FEATURE_VIDEOCAP_GEOMETRY`
request; bit 10 adds the acknowledgement contract. The `REG_ZZ_CONFIG_KEY`
runtime queries 28--34 report requested/applied width and height,
request/applied serials, and status bits `APPLIED_VALID`, `PENDING`,
and `REJECTED`. Requested values retain the override pair, including 0;
applied values are the resolved/clipped VDMA word width and source-row count,
not output pixels or necessarily the same numbers as the request. A request
remains pending until stable native-vblank VDMA programming succeeds with
that serial. RTG vblanks and VDMA configuration/address/start failures do
not acknowledge it; a failed pending request retries on a stable native
vblank. Tools must not treat a successful feature write as an applied window.

Live calibration reads the capture-domain resolved automatic crop at
`VCAP_LIVE_EFFECTIVE_CROP` (host offset `0x140c`), including doubled/short-line
crop replacement and PAL/NTSC vertical changes. Crop axes and the live line
count cross coherently into the AXI domain; a crop commit is acknowledged
only after its resolved pair is visible there. `REG_ZZ_VIDEOCAP_STATS`
(`0x4e`) returns the ten-bit frame line count with reserved bits zero in
both word halves, including the upper half used by Zorro II reads.

RTG/native switches keep the HDMI signal running when the complete output
timing is unchanged; framebuffer layout, scaling and pixel format still update.
For example, centered native 60 Hz and 1920x1080 RTG using the same preset
do not need transmitter or pixel-clock retraining. Matching resolution alone
is not enough: different refresh rates or sync timings still require an output
mode change. Entering `centered_1080p_match` also retains its safe source-phase
acquisition described below.

The existing `full_exact` profile selects fixed PAL/NTSC timing
approximations (about 49.93/59.95 Hz); it does not phase-lock to the input.
The experimental `centered_1080p_match` profile instead tracks the captured
source cadence by adjusting vertical blanking. Interlaced input uses a
bounded field-pair phase correction rather than copying alternating field
anchor intervals directly into output frame lengths; progressive input
retains direct anchor tracking. This is not a fixed 50/60 Hz approximation.
During interlaced acquisition or reacquisition, pixels remain hidden until
the output reaches a safe capture/read phase. Cadence lock can precede this;
monitor sync continues while the phase converges.
Use the matching experimental bitstream, firmware, `ZZ9000.card` and ZZTop.
The cadence-repair candidate passed native-pixel hardware testing on an
A4000 with a default-Z3 ZZ9000: all tested interlace modes displayed correctly
with no reported visual anomalies. This qualifies that tested setup, not
monitor acceptance or tear-free operation on every machine.

ZZTop's **Scandoubler** window groups dependent **Output**/**Refresh**,
scanlines and parity. Its **Capture…** button opens sampling, framing and
native-picture preview/calibration. Open it with the main **Scandoubler…**
button directly above **Audio…**, or **Project > Scandoubler…**; the menu
remains accessible when bottom buttons are off-screen.
**Project > Settings…** opens INT2, MAC, HDF, offscreen-bitmap and video-overlay
configuration; **Project > Audio…** opens audio controls.

Each editor applies its own edits and ENV overrides while preserving
supported settings from the other sections. General Settings Save keeps
absent/commented native keys inactive rather than persisting default output
or unsaved live scanline changes. Scandoubler Save activates its displayed
native settings. Save keeps the previous file as `ZZ9000.bak`; power-cycle
afterwards to apply Output/Refresh and other boot settings. Scanline mode
and parity change live but still need Save for persistence.

See the driver's [Output/Refresh profile table](https://github.com/BlitterStudio/zz9000-drivers#scandoubler-output-and-refresh)
for every supported selector combination.

Keep these rules in mind:

- Existing `ENV:` variables and ZZ9000.card tooltypes take precedence over
  equivalent file settings. Remove old overrides when migrating.
- Use `videocap_profile` for new files. The older independent video keys remain
  accepted only for compatibility.
- Invalid or unknown entries are skipped rather than preventing boot.
- Some options require matching current firmware, bitstream, and drivers.

See the commented [ZZ9000.CFG sample](ZZ9000.CFG) for every accepted value and
additional notes.

## AGA video-slot capture clock (formerly A4000 C28)

The separate AGA (`zorro3-aga`, formerly A4000 C28) bitstreams capture AGA pixels from the 28 MHz
video-slot signal. They run the capture MMCM at approximately 908-916 MHz,
with one capture clock per source pixel. E7M bitstreams remain available
for A3000, other machines, and A4000 fallback; the clock source cannot be
changed by ZZ9000.CFG alone. Other machines and adapter routes require
separate clock qualification.

Build the AGA (video-slot C28) release bitstream with Vivado 2018.3 using
`build_variant_bitstreams.sh zorro3-aga`;
see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md). For a separate single-image diagnostic build
on Windows:

```powershell
.\build_bitstream.ps1 -CaptureC28
```

Its default output is `bootimage_work/capture-c28/zz9000_ps_wrapper.bit`,
not the release bitstream. Package any diagnostic build with the matching
ARM firmware using `build_bootimage.sh --bitstream` and a separate
`--output` path. A missing or out-of-range C28 signal holds native
capture inactive; independent host diagnostics remain available.

Use the matching `ZZCapture` tool from the
[drivers repository](https://github.com/BlitterStudio/zz9000-drivers)
(`ZZCapture/README.md`) to inspect clocks and calibrate a still SuperHires pattern. It checks exact
raw RGB values and frame stability, sweeps the complete phase circle, refines
the clean boundaries, and retests their midpoint. On failure it attempts and
checks entry-phase restoration, reporting any failure. On success it prints
`videocap_c28_phase`; saving is explicit. Run `Stack 32768` in the Amiga Shell
before applying a phase or starting calibration.
This key is independent of the legacy diagnostic `videocap_phase` because
the clocks use different phase units. Matching firmware and ZZTop preserve
both values when saving other settings.

Qualification needs cold and warm tests on affected PAL and NTSC machines,
then lores, hires, SuperHires, progressive/interlaced and filtered/full-detail
checks. Calibration samples raw input pixels; it does not qualify vertical
geometry or the complete HDMI path. Keep the previous working BOOT image
for comparison and restoration.

## Custom Picasso96 Modelines

Matched `ZZ9000.card` 2.11 and firmware advertising `ZZ_FW_CAP_CUSTOM_MODE`
(capability bit 7) support custom progressive RTG timings, including 960x720.
No new FPGA registers are required. The driver sends active dimensions,
sync positions, totals, common sync polarity, and a legal pixel-clock PLL
tuple through the existing custom-mode register window.

Custom timings have these bounds:

- Active width 320–2560 pixels, aligned to 8 pixels; height at least 200.
- Positive front porch, sync width, and back porch on both axes; totals
  at most 4095.
- Pixel clock 25–165 MHz, resolved to the nearest supported PLL clock
  within 0.5% of the request. P96 receives the achieved clock; requests
  with no legal clock inside that tolerance are rejected.
- Progressive scan only. Both syncs must have the same polarity: the
  current formatter has one polarity bit shared by HSync and VSync.

The firmware stages the whole modeline before applying it. Invalid or
incomplete requests do not alter the live mode; a PLL lock failure triggers
rollback to the previous output. Video interrupts are deferred during
the transaction; audio and other interrupts remain enabled. Exact packaged presets retain their
existing output timings. In particular, their historical P96 polarity
flags do not change the fixed preset's polarity.

Use P96's temporary test display before saving a custom mode. Firmware
acceptance does not guarantee that the connected monitor supports it.
Back up the installed `BOOT.bin`, `ZZ9000.card`, and P96 settings first;
see the [driver instructions](https://github.com/BlitterStudio/zz9000-drivers#custom-picasso96-modelines).

## USB host stack

Firmware 2.8.0 RC3 and `zzusbhw.device` 2.2 form one USB proxy release. The
matched pair negotiates protocol v2 before advertising persistent interrupt,
simple ISO, or realtime ISO support. A driver that does not receive the
required capability set leaves those public capabilities disabled rather than
using an incompatible mailbox path.

Implemented transport paths are control, bulk, persistent interrupt, and
high-speed or split full-speed ISO IN/OUT. Full-speed ISO requires a
high-speed hub transaction translator. Direct low-speed devices remain
unadvertised. MIDIStreaming stays on its descriptor-defined bulk endpoints;
enabling USB audio ISO does not reroute MIDI through ISO.

Host-side models cover mailbox ownership, EHCI retirement, error mapping,
periodic cadence, ISO descriptors/batches, and stop/reset races. These are not
physical-device qualification. The current hardware evidence and every
unavailable topology are listed in the drivers repository's
[`docs/usb-qualification-matrix.md`](https://github.com/BlitterStudio/zz9000-drivers/blob/master/docs/usb-qualification-matrix.md).
Run the matched `ZZDiag` binary on AmigaOS to capture driver/firmware
capabilities, epochs, counters, queue state, schedule bits, and recent events.

## Amiga MMU and Cache Notes

On 68040/68060 systems, configure any pure ZZ9000 RAM window in the
Amiga-side MMU tool. For the optional Zorro III FastRAM range,
`Writethrough` has shown the best tested performance because CPU reads
can still benefit from cache while writes reach the board immediately.
In MuLibs/MMULib terms, this is typically:

```text
For 28014 5 SetCacheMode {base} {size} Valid Writethrough
```

Avoid `CopyBack` for ZZ9000 RAM unless the driver and workload are known
to be cache-coherent. Keep MMIO, register, boot, USB, Ethernet, and other
FPGA/ARM shared windows cache inhibited or data no-cache. If a machine is
unstable with `Writethrough`, fall back to `Data NoCache` /
`CacheInhibit` for the configured Zorro RAM range. Leave instruction
cache enabled. 68030 systems do not need this workaround.

If a 68040/68060 machine remains unstable with Zorro III FastRAM enabled,
remove `fast_ram` from (or set `fast_ram = off` in) `ZZ9000.CFG` and reboot.

## Building

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for the complete build flow and toolchain
details. On this repo, the normal firmware/BOOT image loop uses the
committed bitstream in `bootimage_work/` and does not require Vivado:

```bash
export PATH="$PWD/.toolchain/arm-gnu-toolchain/bin:$PATH"
./build_firmware.sh clean
./build_firmware.sh
BOOTGEN="$PWD/.toolchain/bootgen/bootgen" ./build_bootimage.sh
```

The build scripts are intentionally composable:

| Script | Output |
|---|---|
| [`build_firmware.sh`](build_firmware.sh) | `ZZ9000OS.elf` |
| [`build_bootimage.sh`](build_bootimage.sh) | `BOOT.bin` |
| [`build_release_assets.sh`](build_release_assets.sh) | release ZIPs |
| [`build_bitstream.sh`](build_bitstream.sh) | default FPGA bitstream |
| [`build_variant_bitstreams.sh`](build_variant_bitstreams.sh) | release variant bitstreams |

Vivado 2018.3 is required only for bitstream rebuilds. CI does not run
Vivado, so HDL changes must commit the rebuilt bitstream files under
`bootimage_work/`.

## Testing

Firmware builds are covered by the GitHub Actions workflow in
[`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml), which also
runs every host suite below and checks the mailbox ABI against the SDK.
All of them run locally without hardware:

```bash
make -C test/rtg test          # RTG correctness
make -C test/rtg bench         # host micro-benchmarks (comparative only)
make -C test/video test        # VDMA math + video_formatter invariants
make -C test/video_codec test  # pl_mpeg fixture + exact YUY2 output
make -C test/media test        # media session state and timing
make -C test/palette test      # primary-CLUT shadow + query packing
make -C test/audio test        # audio capture
make -C test/config test       # ZZ9000.CFG parser/loader
make -C test/scheduler test    # dual-core queue, routing, reclaim
make -C test/allocator test    # surface allocator
make -C test/aperture test     # Z2 aperture layout/ack contract
make -C test/fwupdate test     # firmware-file restore
make -C test/sd_activity_led test
```

The video pipeline has its own harness under [`test/video/`](test/video/):
host-side checks (`make -C test/video test`) plus a functional Vivado xsim
testbench that drives `video_formatter.v` with a modeled VDMA stream and
compares every displayed pixel across all color modes, scaling modes and
line widths:

```bash
test/video/run_formatter_sim.sh current   # working-tree formatter
test/video/run_formatter_sim.sh master    # committed baseline
```

Hardware validation is still required before treating performance or bus
timing changes as proven.

## Release Process

Release CI is tag-driven. Push a `v*` tag and the workflow builds the
single standard firmware flavor, packages every committed hardware
variant bitstream (each ZIP includes the sample `ZZ9000.CFG`), and
publishes a GitHub Release. Tags containing `-`, such as
`v2.3.0-rc1`, are marked as pre-releases. Do not add an extra
`ns-pal` release flavor; use `ZZ9000.CFG` for PAL/native-video
defaults and related boot-time settings.

```bash
git tag -a v2.3.0 -m "Firmware 2.3.0"
git push origin v2.3.0
```
